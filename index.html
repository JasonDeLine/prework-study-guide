      <h2>CSS Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS – defines a style in the same line of code as what it is styling</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet – contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file which defines rules that only apply to that page. Can configure/define classes and IDs which identify elements that style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet – Most common. Maintains CSS rules in a separate file from the HTML file, and makes design changes easier</li>
