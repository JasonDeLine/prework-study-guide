          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <h2>CSS Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS – defines a style in the same line of code as what it is styling</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet – contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file which defines rules that only apply to that page. Can configure/define classes and IDs which identify elements that style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet – Most common. Maintains CSS rules in a separate file from the HTML file, and makes design changes easier</li>

        <h2>JavaScript Notes</h2>  
          <ul>
            <li>Control Flow – the order in which a computer executes code in JS files. In order top to bottom</li>
            <li>Conditional statements and loops – allow us to control order in which code is executed , or if it is even executed at all</li>
            <li>Array – single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Typically used to store data that is related in some way</li>
            <li>Index – location of a single data point within an array. </li>
            <li>Function – set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform certain tasks. Functions to not automatically execute when the JS file is run unlike a loop or For statement. You must call out a function by name in order for it to execute</li>
            <li>Two requirements for a Function: Define the function, and Call the funciton</li>
