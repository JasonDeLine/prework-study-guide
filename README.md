# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Webpage built to store notes taken during my prework courses ahead of coding bootcamp. This project was built to begin understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how each builds on the other to create the finished and working webpage. During this process I learned components HTML and how to use HTML to create a framework of the website I am building. With that knowledge, I began to understand how to create a style sheet using CSS to tell my HTML code how to display certain aspects of the webpage including colors, margins and padding, and creating elements such as text boxes. Once the style was established I began working with JavaScript to add functionality through the use of Loops, Arrays, and Functions which can be viewed in the Console log.
